# ‚ú® RCLONE AUTO REFRESH TOKEN ‚ú®

- This repo will help to check your remotes' storage / list album of GGPhotos to refresh the tokens
- When you don't use your remote for a time, its token is expired itself
- This repo keeps your remotes' tokens alive, not to be expired
- Automatically run using Github Action on Cron Schedule
  > Default: At minute 0 past every 48th hour

# NOTES: üìù

- The old workflows runs will be deleted after 10080 minutes _(7 days)_
  > Run by [`Delete old workflows runs.yml`](.github/workflows/Delete%20old%20workflows%20runs.yml)
- This repo will cache the Rclone, save up time to setup Rclone
  > If you face any error or want to update newer Rclone version, delete the old cache `cache-rclone` in Actions tab ‚Üí Management ‚Üí Caches
- I've just tested `GoogleDrive`, `OneDrive`, `Mega`, `Dropbox`, `GGPhotos`. Others I haven't tested yet.
- Not support `Shared Google Drive` and `Combine`
- If you face any error, create an issue and type in the full log of the failed step
  > Don't forget to censore your personal information in the log
